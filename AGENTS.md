# AGENTS.md

## Project overview

This project is a Windows desktop utility written in C#.

The goal is to detect when a configured game character is speaking and temporarily mute or reduce the game process audio. Later versions may support OCR-based speaker detection and optional screen-region masking.

The project should behave like a local accessibility/preferences tool.

The agent should prioritize:

- correctness;
- safety;
- reversibility;
- minimal changes;
- small testable modules;
- command-line verifiable results;
- clear separation between prototype code and long-term architecture.

## Current milestone

The current milestone is **v0.2 Local JSON Configuration**.

The previous **v0.1 Audio MVP** is considered implemented and manually verified:

- simulated speaker input works;
- mute coordination works;
- real Windows audio mode is opt-in only;
- target-process mute mode works;
- target-process reduce-volume mode works;
- shutdown restore behavior works in the tested manual path.

Scope for v0.2:

- Console app only.
- Local JSON configuration support.
- CLI arguments may override JSON configuration.
- Target process name should be configurable.
- Target speaker list should be configurable.
- Real audio opt-in should be configurable.
- Audio filter mode should be configurable.
- Reduce-volume percentage should be configurable.
- Default run must remain safe and must not control real system audio unless explicitly enabled by config or CLI.
- Existing v0.1 audio behavior must remain stable.
- .NET 8.
- Windows x64.
- VS Code / Codex / Visual Studio friendly workflow.

Out of scope for the current milestone:

- OCR.
- Screen capture.
- WPF.
- WinUI.
- Overlay masking.
- Face detection.
- ONNX.
- OpenCV.
- Persistent settings UI.
- Gameplay automation.
- Keyboard/mouse automation.
- Anti-cheat bypass.
- Game memory reading or modification.

Done when:

- `dotnet build` passes.
- If tests exist, `dotnet test` passes.
- The app can run without a config file using safe defaults.
- The app can load local JSON config with target process, target speakers, audio mode, volume percent, and real-audio opt-in.
- CLI arguments can override config file values where supported.
- Invalid config produces clear errors.
- Default execution still does not control real system audio.
- The final response reports changed files, verification commands, assumptions, and limitations.

Do not implement later roadmap phases until this milestone works.

## Tech stack

- Language: C#
- Runtime: .NET 8 or newer
- Target OS: Windows
- Target architecture: Windows x64
- Initial app type: console app
- Later GUI options: WPF or WinUI, but only after configuration and detection flows are stable and explicitly requested
- Audio control: NAudio or Windows Core Audio APIs
- Configuration: local JSON using .NET built-in JSON support unless a stronger reason is documented
- Image processing later: TBD
- OCR later: TBD
- Packaging later: TBD

Do not assume administrator privileges unless explicitly required and explained.

Do not introduce OCR, image-processing, UI, model-inference, capture, overlay, or gameplay automation dependencies during the v0.2 Local JSON Configuration milestone.

## Tooling workflow

Codex Windows desktop app, Visual Studio, and VS Code are all available.

Use this division of responsibility:

- Codex Windows desktop app:
  - primary agent workspace;
  - focused code changes;
  - reviewable diffs;
  - Git worktrees;
  - small implementation tasks;
  - code review tasks;
  - command-line verification.

- Visual Studio:
  - debugging;
  - breakpoint inspection;
  - WPF / WinUI work later;
  - NuGet inspection;
  - Windows-specific diagnostics;
  - audio API / COM debugging;
  - runtime behavior verification.

- VS Code:
  - lightweight editing;
  - markdown files;
  - small manual edits;
  - terminal workflows;
  - quick code review.

Do not rely on Visual Studio-only workflows unless explicitly requested.

All essential build, test, and run steps must work from the `dotnet` CLI.

Visual Studio may be used for debugging, but command-line verification is still required before a task is considered complete.

## Development phases

Follow this order unless the user explicitly changes the roadmap:

1. Simulated speaker input + target process mute/restore.
2. Real Windows audio control behind `IAudioMuteService`.
3. Audio filter modes: mute and reduce volume.
4. Local JSON configuration.
5. Window capture prototype.
6. OCR text extraction from a configurable screen region.
7. Speaker detection from OCR text.
8. Stable mute/unmute coordination with debounce and recovery.
9. Minimal UI.
10. Optional screen-region masking prototype.
11. Optional dynamic mask or model-based detection prototype.

Do not implement later-phase functionality prematurely.

For every task, identify which phase is being worked on and avoid touching unrelated phases.

## Core modules

Use these module boundaries unless the user asks for a different design:

- `IGameWindowCapture`: captures frames from the target game window.
- `IOcrService`: extracts text from a specific screen region.
- `ISpeakerDetector`: determines the current speaker from OCR text or simulated input.
- `IAudioMuteService`: mutes, reduces, and restores the target game process or audio session according to configured audio filtering behavior.
- `MuteCoordinator`: coordinates speaker detection, mute/filter state, debounce logic, and recovery.
- `AppSettings`: stores target characters, target process name, OCR region, timing thresholds, audio settings, and feature toggles.
- `AppSettingsLoader`: loads and validates local JSON configuration.
- `AudioFilterOptions`: stores mute/reduce-volume behavior and validation rules.

For v0.2, expected work is limited to:

- `AppSettings`
- `AppSettingsLoader`
- configuration validation
- CLI/config merge behavior
- example JSON configuration
- tests for configuration loading and validation

Do not create `IGameWindowCapture` or `IOcrService` implementations until the project reaches the corresponding phases.

## Architecture rules

- UI code must not directly call Windows audio APIs.
- Windows API, COM interop, OCR provider code, screen capture code, and overlay code must be isolated behind service interfaces.
- OCR logic must be replaceable.
- Do not hard-code one OCR provider into core business logic.
- Audio mute/reduce/restore logic must be reversible.
- The application must attempt to restore audio on cancellation, shutdown, and unexpected exceptions.
- Prefer explicit state machines for audio-filter transitions instead of scattered boolean flags.
- Keep core logic testable without launching the game, changing system volume, or requiring OCR.
- Do not put large procedural logic in `Program.cs`.
- Do not put large procedural logic in UI event handlers.
- Do not rewrite unrelated files.
- Do not rename files, classes, public methods, or public APIs unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer the smallest change that solves the current task.
- Do not add abstractions that are not needed for the current phase.
- Do not implement multiple roadmap phases in one task unless explicitly requested.
- Do not silently change existing behavior.

## Mute coordination rules

`MuteCoordinator` should use explicit states when practical, for example:

- `Idle`
- `Muted`
- `Restoring`
- `Faulted`

Required behavior:

- Target speaker starts speaking → apply configured audio filtering to the target process/audio session.
- Target speaker stops speaking → restore audio.
- Non-target speaker speaks → do not apply audio filtering.
- Unknown speaker or detection failure → do not newly apply audio filtering.
- Detection failures must not leave audio permanently filtered.
- Repeated frames or repeated simulated inputs with the same speaker must not trigger repeated audio API calls.
- OCR jitter must later be handled with debounce or hysteresis.
- Restore should be idempotent: calling restore multiple times should be safe.
- Mute/reduce should be idempotent: repeated target detections while already filtered should not spam the audio API or repeatedly reduce volume.
- Shutdown, cancellation, and unexpected exceptions should attempt safe restore.

For v0.2:

- Avoid changing `MuteCoordinator` unless configuration wiring requires a minimal adjustment.
- Existing v0.1 behavior must remain stable.
- Do not add OCR-specific debounce logic until OCR exists.

## Safety rules

- Never modify game files.
- Do not inject code into the game process.
- Do not read or modify game memory.
- Do not implement anti-cheat bypass logic.
- Do not implement hook-based gameplay automation.
- Do not implement DirectX hooks unless explicitly discussed and approved later.
- Do not implement behavior that automates gameplay decisions.
- Do not add auto-clicking, auto-dialogue skipping, or input simulation unless explicitly requested later.
- Prefer screen capture, OCR, and OS-level audio session control over invasive game modification.
- If a requested feature requires invasive game modification, explain the risk and propose non-invasive alternatives instead.
- Do not store sensitive user data, credentials, cookies, tokens, or game login information.
- Do not send game data or screenshots to external services unless explicitly requested and reviewed.
- Do not add telemetry.

## Configuration rules

Store user configuration in a local JSON file unless the project already uses another configuration format.

For v0.2:

- Local JSON configuration is allowed and expected.
- Do not add a persistent settings UI.
- Do not store sensitive information.
- Do not include credentials, cookies, tokens, or game login data.
- Do not make network requests for configuration.
- Do not silently create or overwrite user configuration without explicit request.
- A sample configuration file such as `config.example.json` is allowed.
- If a default runtime config is created later, it must be safe by default.

Configuration should include at least:

- `TargetProcessName`
- `TargetSpeakers`
- `RealAudioEnabled`
- `AudioFilter.Mode`
- `AudioFilter.VolumePercent`

Long-term configuration may later include:

- mute delay/debounce settings;
- restore delay/debounce settings;
- OCR region;
- feature toggles;
- restore behavior;
- logging options.

Default safe values should be:

- `RealAudioEnabled = false`
- `TargetProcessName = "GenshinImpact"`
- `TargetSpeakers = ["派蒙", "Paimon"]`
- `AudioFilter.Mode = "Mute"`
- `AudioFilter.VolumePercent = 30`

Validate configuration values before using them.

Validation should reject:

- blank target process name;
- null or empty target speaker list;
- null, blank, or duplicate-only target speaker entries;
- unknown audio filter mode;
- `ReduceVolume` mode with `VolumePercent` outside 1 to 100.

Invalid configuration should produce a clear error message.

CLI arguments may override JSON configuration values. Override behavior should be explicit and documented.

## Coding rules

- Use clear C# names.
- Use PascalCase for public members.
- Use `_camelCase` for private fields.
- Keep classes small and focused.
- Add short XML doc comments for public interfaces and important public methods.
- Add Chinese comments for non-obvious logic.
- Do not add long comments for obvious syntax.
- Prefer dependency injection for services that touch the OS, OCR, screen capture, overlay windows, or external libraries.
- Do not introduce new NuGet packages without explaining why.
- Avoid swallowing exceptions silently.
- Use `CancellationToken` for long-running loops or background detection tasks.
- Dispose unmanaged resources and image/audio handles properly.
- Avoid blocking the UI thread.
- Prefer simple, explicit code over clever abstractions.
- Do not create unrelated helper classes.
- Do not move files unless the move directly supports the current task.
- Do not rename output files unnecessarily.
- Keep command examples single-line when practical.

## Dependency rules

Prefer the .NET standard library and existing project dependencies.

Do not add OCR, image-processing, model-inference, capture, overlay, or UI dependencies without explaining:

- why the dependency is needed;
- why existing code is insufficient;
- whether the dependency affects deployment;
- whether it requires native runtime components;
- whether it affects Windows x64 packaging;
- whether there are licensing concerns.

Do not replace the project framework or UI stack without explicit approval.

For v0.2:

- Use built-in .NET JSON support where practical.
- Existing NAudio dependency for real Windows audio control may remain.
- Do not add OpenCV.
- Do not add OCR libraries.
- Do not add ONNX Runtime.
- Do not add WPF or WinUI dependencies.
- Do not add global hotkey libraries.
- Do not add configuration frameworks unless strongly justified.
- Do not add logging frameworks unless explicitly requested.

## Build and run commands

Use these commands unless the project defines more specific ones:

- Restore: `dotnet restore`
- Build: `dotnet build`
- Test: `dotnet test`
- Run: `dotnet run --project <PROJECT_PATH>`

If the project contains a `.sln` file, prefer solution-level commands:

- Build solution: `dotnet build <SOLUTION_NAME>.sln`
- Test solution: `dotnet test <SOLUTION_NAME>.sln`

Visual Studio may be used for debugging, but command-line verification is still required before completion.

Do not claim a command passed unless it was actually run and its output was checked.

If a command cannot be run, state the exact reason.

## Testing instructions

Core mute coordination logic must be testable without actually changing system volume.

Use fake implementations for:

- `IAudioMuteService`
- `ISpeakerDetector`
- `IGameWindowCapture`
- `IOcrService`

For v0.2, prioritize tests for:

- default `AppSettings`;
- valid JSON configuration loading;
- missing config file error;
- invalid JSON error where practical;
- blank target process name rejected;
- empty target speaker list rejected;
- invalid audio filter mode rejected;
- invalid reduce-volume percentage rejected;
- CLI override behavior if argument parsing is structured for testing;
- existing mute/reduce coordination behavior remains unchanged.

Existing v0.1 tests should continue covering:

- target speaker starts speaking;
- target speaker stops speaking;
- non-target speaker speaks;
- unknown speaker does not newly mute/filter;
- repeated speaker frames do not cause repeated audio API calls;
- restore is safe when called multiple times;
- mute/reduce is safe when called multiple times;
- exception during detection does not break recovery logic;
- cancellation or shutdown attempts to restore audio.

For later OCR phases, test at least:

- OCR jitter does not cause rapid mute/unmute;
- OCR failure does not leave audio permanently muted;
- OCR raw text normalization is separated from speaker matching.

Do not write automated tests that modify real system audio.

Do not weaken or delete existing tests to make the build pass.

If tests are not added for new core logic, explain why.

## MVP rules

For early prototypes:

- Prefer simulated speaker input before adding OCR.
- Prefer console or minimal UI before full desktop UI.
- Build the smallest working vertical slice:
  1. detect or simulate speaker name;
  2. decide whether to apply audio filtering;
  3. mute or reduce target process/audio session;
  4. restore audio;
  5. log state changes.

The v0.1 audio MVP is implemented; v0.2 should preserve it while adding local JSON configuration.

Do not add masking, OCR, complex UI, persistent settings UI, model inference, or capture code during v0.2.

Do not optimize prematurely.

Do not build a framework before the next behavior is verified.

## Logging rules

Log important state transitions:

- detected speaker changed;
- target speaker detected;
- non-target speaker detected;
- audio filter requested;
- mute requested;
- reduce-volume requested;
- restore requested;
- restore succeeded;
- restore skipped because already restored;
- repeated audio filter skipped because already active;
- detection error;
- audio control error;
- configuration load error;
- configuration validation error;
- CLI override applied where helpful;
- cancellation requested;
- shutdown restore attempted.

Do not log sensitive user information.

Logs should help debug state transitions, configuration values, and timing issues.

Do not spam logs in tight loops.

## Git and change management rules

Keep changes small and reviewable.

Before large changes, explain the intended file list.

Prefer one task per commit.

Do not mix unrelated changes in one task.

Before finishing, inspect the diff and verify that no unrelated files were changed.

If using Codex worktrees or parallel tasks:

- avoid multiple agents editing the same files at the same time;
- avoid parallel changes to `.csproj`, `Program.cs`, `AppSettings`, and core interfaces unless coordinated;
- merge only after build/test verification.

## Documentation rules

Maintain these files when relevant:

- `README.md`: user-facing setup, run, and manual verification.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: project phases and milestone status.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`: important technical decisions and reasons.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent instructions and engineering rules.
- `config.example.json`: example local configuration for safe startup and manual testing.

For meaningful behavior changes, update `README.md` or relevant docs.

For important architectural choices, update `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Do not add excessive documentation for trivial changes.

## Done criteria

Before finishing a task:

- The project should build with `dotnet build`.
- If tests exist, run `dotnet test`.
- New core logic should have focused tests where practical.
- If a command cannot be run, state the exact reason.
- Verify that the task did not exceed the requested roadmap phase.
- Verify that no unrelated files were modified.
- Verify that default run remains safe and does not control real system audio unless explicitly enabled.
- Verify that the final response contains concrete command results, not assumptions.

The final response must include:

- changed files;
- what changed;
- commands run;
- result of each command;
- assumptions;
- untested behavior or known limitations.

## Final response format

After making code changes, respond in this format:

```text
Changed files:
- path/to/file.cs: what changed

Verification:
- dotnet restore: passed/failed/not run, with reason
- dotnet build: passed/failed/not run, with reason
- dotnet test: passed/failed/not run, with reason
- manual run: passed/failed/not run, with reason

Notes:
- assumptions
- limitations
- follow-up suggestions if needed
```

Do not say the task is complete if build or test verification failed, unless the failure is explicitly explained and the remaining issue is documented.
